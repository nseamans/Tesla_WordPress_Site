        Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.) is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in 
        Palo Alto, California. Tesla's current products  include electric cars (the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and 
        Model Y), battery energy storage from home to grid scale (the Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack), solar 
        panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services.
      </p>
      <p class="testimony-quote-info">
        Founded in July 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company’s name 
        is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car 
        manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer 
        software and the proprietary motor". The next three employees at Tesla were Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and J. B. 
        Straubel.Musk, who has served as CEO since 2008, said in 2006 that "the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors...is 
        to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy toward a solar electric economy" and it 
        would build a wide range of electric vehicles, including "affordably priced family cars", and co-market 
        SolarCity solar panels to do so. Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016.
      </p>
      <p class="testimony-quote-info">
        After 11 years in the market, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in and battery electric passenger 
        car manufacturer in 2019, with a market share of 17% of the plug-in segment and 23% of the battery electric segment.
        Tesla global vehicle sales increased 50% from 245,240 units in 2018 to 367,849 units in 2019. In 2020, the company 
        surpassed the 1 million mark of electric cars produced. The Model 3 ranks as the world's all-time best-selling 
        plug-in electric car, with more than 500,000 delivered. Tesla cars accounted for 81% of the battery electric 
        vehicles sold in the United States in the first half of 2020.

    <p class="testimony-quote-info">
      Our goal when we created Tesla a decade ago was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass 	   market electric cars to market as soon as possible. If we could have done that with our first product, we would have, but that was simply impossible to       achieve for a startup company that had never built a car and that had one technology iteration and no economies of scale. Our first product was going to       be expensive no matter what it looked like, so we decided to build a sports car, as that seemed like it had the best chance of being competitive with    	   its gasoline alternatives.
